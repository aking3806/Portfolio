"1. CBP data includes the number of establishments, employment during the week of March 12, and annual payroll. CBP basic data are extracted from the Business Register (BR), a database of all known single and multi-establishment employer companies maintained and updated by the U.S. Census Bureau. Primary causes of differences between CBP employment estimates and ACS estimates: CBP does not cover the self-employed, public employment, and most agricultural employment; CBP estimates are not based on a sample survey; they represent business location as opposed to workers' residence in the district; use the week of March 12 as a reference period; and use a business source to determine industry."
2. Industries not classified - Industry could not be determined.
"3. Statewide - County Business Patterns data includes employers without a fixed location within a state (or of unknown county location). These employers are included under a ""statewide"" classification in county-level tables. Statewide cases are not included in any particular congressional district (though they would be included in at-large districts). This incomplete detail may cause a slight understatement of a district's total data."
